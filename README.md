# Octane-install
Notes on SGI Octane and Octane 2 network installation of Irix 6.5.30 using [unxmaal's booterizer](https://github.com/unxmaal/booterizer) from the serial console.
These notes are to help myself remember all the steps. I make them public in case it helps someone, but they are not meant to cover all cases.

## Clear PROM password (optional)
Turn the Octane off and remove the main board. Change the configuration of the password jumper very near the CPU. The first boot will be very slow after changing the jumper configuration. 
Turn on the Octane. Go into maintenance mode and enter the Command Prompt mode by entering 5. Type:

    resetpw
    resetenv
    setenv console d
 
Shutdown the Octane and reset the password jumper to its initial position. 
 

## Format and test disks
Turn on the Octane. At the serial console prompt enter the Command Prompt mode by entering 5

Press 5 and enter.
Set the network info, start the partitioner

    setenv netaddr 192.0.2.2
    bootp():/6.5.30/Overlay/disc1/stand/fx.64 -x

Then input and output should be as follows:

At this stage, it's possible to get an error like `A 000: *** TLB Refill Exception on node 0`. This happens when performing an install through the serial console when the console is set to graphical in the nvrom. To fix, `setenv console d` at the monitor prompt. Don't forget to set it back after the install with `setenv console g`.

```
Press `q` a few times to get through all the READMEs. Then

    Select appropriate software stream to install.
    -------------------------------------------------
    Before you install an intermediate release, you must select
    between two streams of installable software: the maintenance
    stream, which contains accumulated bug fixes and any required software
    for new hardware components; or the feature stream, which contains
    accumulated bug fixes, any required software for new hardware
    components, and new hardware and software features.  After your
    selection, inst automatically identifies the modules in the stream
    that you selected and loads them with no further prompting.
    The currently loaded distributions contain maintenance and feature
    stream products.
    Select the maintenance stream if you simply want to maintain the
    current hardware and software functions on your system.  The
    maintenance stream insures compatibility of new hardware components.

    Select the feature stream if you want to upgrade hardware and
    software with new features.  Occasionally, the feature stream
    introduces incompatibilities between old and new hardware components.

    To change the stream selection between maintenance and feature,
    reset the stream preference to the new setting.  In some cases,
    resetting the stream preference and installing products from the
    new stream requires reinstalling portions of the IRIX operating system.
    -------------------------------------------------
    1. Place me on the maintenance stream.
    2. Place me on the feature stream.
    3. Cancel

    This distribution contains overlay products.  You may need to specify

    If you do not load all the related distributions now, "Conflict" messages

## Post install tips

### Setting parameters in OS
To set prom from OS command line, `man nvram`  

### Setting resolution
To set resolution from OS command line, `man setmon`  
Resolution can also be set with GUI util "Display Properties" in menu bar  
Resolution can also be set in PROM with `setenv monitor l` for 1024x768 resolution, or `setenv monitor h` for 1280x1024  

### Boot problem
If the machine won't boot, with the error

    Autoboot failed.
    xio(0)pci(15)scsi(0)disk(1)rdisk(0)partition(0): execute format error
  
Then check that the autoboot is configured properly
    
    printenv
    ...
    OSLoadFilename=/unix
    OSLoader=sash

If not, set it manually with `setenv`

    setenv OSLoadFilename /unix
    setenv OSLoader sash
